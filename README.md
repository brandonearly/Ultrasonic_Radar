Computational Sensor- Ultrasonic Based 180 Degree 'Radar'

This project makes use of the ultrasonic sensor included in the arduino kit as well as the servo motor to rotate the sensor 180 degrees, and take measurement data of anything the sensor might see. It then plots this data on a polar (r, theta) graph. All data points are saved into vectors, and while they are removed from the plot after a period of time, they remain stored in memory.

The code below is setup to run based on this wiring diagram:
